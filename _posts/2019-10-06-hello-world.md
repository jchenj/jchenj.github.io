Welcome to my blog! You'll find here notes on my adventures with the Python programming language and other topics of interest. 
Huge kudos to Jonathan McGlone for his post ["Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub"] 
(http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) that provided a great step-by-step guide to getting a blog site up and running 
using [GitHub Pages] (https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll] (https://jekyllrb.com/)!
