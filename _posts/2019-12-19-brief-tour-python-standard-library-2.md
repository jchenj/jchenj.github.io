title: Brief Tour of the Standard Library, Part II

The second part of the tour of the Python standard library covers more advanced modules. Again, I'll organize my notes into two sections: one for those modules I've already worked with and the other for modules that were new to me. 

## New (to me) modules:
### reprlib
* reprlib.repr(*obj*) returns an abbreviated printable version of an object

### textwrap
* Formats paragraphs of text to fit a given screen width

### locale
* Accesses a library of locale-specific data formats

* Can set the locale and format string's according to the conventions of that locale

## Modules I've worked with previously:
### pprint
* Can specify max. width of printed result in second argument - pprint.pprint(*object, max. width*)
