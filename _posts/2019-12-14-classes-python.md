title: Classes in Python

Inspired by a talk on "Learning in Public" I heard at at meetup last week, I'm going to document my learning more on this blog 
rather than posting more "significant" problems solved. These posts are intended mostly as notes to myself on lessons learned. <br>

I've been working through the official Python tutorial (release 3.7.5) and today began Chapter Nine, Classes. Drawing on the KWL
technique from education, I'll summarize what I know about this topic before doing the tutorial and my current questions about the topic, 
then come back and describe what I learned at a high level once I've completed it. <br>

**Know**
* My previous exposure to classes was toward the end of Nina Zacharenko's course on Front End Masters. From that, I think I recall
that classes are related to object-oriented programming. Classes allow the programmer to create a type of object with certain
attributes. For example, the class *Car* might have four wheels. 
* A programmer can build new objects based on the class of car, and can also make subclasses. For example, there might be a subclass
of *Car* called *Sedan* that has four doors and another subclass called *Hatchback* that has two doors.
* The advantage of classes is that it allows programmers to avoid duplicating code by writing a class once and building on it for additional
needs.<br>
**Want to know** <br>
* I'd like to see how classes are used more practically in writing programs. I understand the car example conceptually, but it 
doesn't seem very useful at this point.
**Learned** <br>
