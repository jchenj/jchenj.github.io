I've been working steadily through the ["Mastering PyCharm"](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/mastering-pycharm-ide) course from TalkPython course over the past couple of weeks and having a great time with it. It feels fantastic to be learning to use a professional-grade tool that will help me code more effectively, while getting exposure to a bunch of new concepts and skills by working through the projects and exercises. Hooray for PyCharm and Talk Python! 

One of the reasons this course has been such a powerful learning experience is it's created so many opportuntities for what I'll call "cascading learning". Far from the course being a simple exercise in following the video's instructions, I've often  needed to do considerable extra research to make the code run on my end, either because software has changed since the video was recorded, or because the underlying concepts are new to me. While this can be a bit frustrating at times, for the most part this has been an incredibly good thing. Rather than learning "just" about PyCharm, I've reinforced & built on the source control basics I learned recently, learned principles of refactoring, and got my first hands-on experiences with databases and, most recently, server-side web applications. So good!

It was in the most recent module that I returned to JavaScript today for the first time since choosing definitively to go with Python as my all-important "first language". I think this was in late 2018 or early 2019. 

As I renewed my resolve to learn to code in mid-2018, I tried out three languages: 1) a version of Scheme, which is used in UBC's first programming course, CS 110, which I took as a MOOC on EdX, 2) Python, which I really dug into using Nina Zacharenko's fundementals course and *Automate the Boring Stuff*, and JavaScript. The latter was my most brief exposure - I just went through some of the videos in the FullStack/Grace Hopper Institute's boot camp prep materials. Eventually, through, I decided to stick with Python as I found the ABS approach of focusing on the automation use case while learning Python highly relevant and felt like I was making good progress there. So I waved goodbye to JS' semicolons, not knowing when or if we would meet again. 

Today I picked up the server-side web apps module at the point where we started discussing static pages. The sequence went something like this:
*Michael Kennedy (instructor)* - OK, let's download BootStrap using npm.

*Me* - What's BootStrap? (*search, search...*) What's npm? (*search, search...*)
OK, I'll run this install command in the terminal... (*tap, tap*)... Whaa, I don't have npm? What do I have to do to get it? (*search, search...*) Ok, guess I need to install Node! 
OK, I'm downloading Node. I'm clicking to install it... Whaa, I'm getting this error, "Canâ€™t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software"! What's up with that?? (*search, search...*)
OK, I've got the workaround. Installing Node... Looks like it worked! Time to check if it installed correctly...
`$ which node`
`/usr/bin/local/node`
`$ node
> console.log('Node is running');
`Node is running`
*Me`: (realizing what just happened) Whaaa! Semicolon! I'm back to JavaScript! 

And that was the moment that, after months of sticking to Python my path converged with JS again - and now, it's not matter of a binary choice between learning language A or B, but a situation where both languages are combined in the same project, I'll have a chance to see them in action together and learn in the process, and I feel very much up to the challenge. 

I got BootStrap installed, and moving onwards!
