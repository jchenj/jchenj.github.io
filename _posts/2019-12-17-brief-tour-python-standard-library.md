title: "Brief Tour of the Standard Library"

Today I started working through Chapter 10 of the Python Tutorial (3.7.5), *Brief Tour of the Standard Library*. 


I have already used the following modules from the standard library by completing through half of Chapter 16 of *Automate 
the Boring Stuff with Python*:


* copy
* csv
* datetime
* json
* logging
* math
* os
* pprint
* random
* re
* shelve
* shutil
* smtplib
* sys
* threading
* time
* traceback
* webbrowser
* zipfile


That's nineteen modules so far - and I might have used a few more when working through other tutorials, etc. 


By going through this section, I'm looking forward to: 

1. Learn about modules I haven't encountered yet
2. Learn more about modules I have used before, and 
3. Learn more about the history, structure and future prospects for the standard library

What I learned about:

## New (to me) modules:

### os
* This is one of the modules I've been using most frequently, especially os.getcwd() and os.chdir()
* One issues - changing wo copying whole path

## Modules I'd used before:

## The history, structure & future prospects of the Python standard library
