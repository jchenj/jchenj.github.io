Added FontAwesome icon. 
Needed to add link to HTML - to CDN to access the link. This wasn't in demo, needed to google around for it
What is CloudFlare? 

And failure - got the icon in but couldn't get it to align on the right though rest of icons on left. I looked at several websites. Decided to move ahead - maybe  will learn this later. 

But would still like to get at least one item to float. Will try with lorem text. 
How to get lorem text: 

Successes:
add lorem text
Add search icon
Add link to lorem source 

Failures: 
float search icon
float image in page content section
change font size of footnote

Didn't get to
increase height of navbar
make bar touch top left and right
