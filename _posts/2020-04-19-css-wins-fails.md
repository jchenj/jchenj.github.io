I was working on making a navbar using CSS today and had a mix of wins and fails. 

###Wins
- When I left off working on this the last time I was trying to add a FontAwesome icon and was missing the stylesheet link. While the docs didn't describe that this link was needed or where to find it, I found it on another site and put it in the HTML file, getting the icon. 

###Fails


And failure - got the icon in but couldn't get it to align on the right though rest of icons on left. I looked at several websites. Decided to move ahead - maybe  will learn this later. 

But would still like to get at least one item to float. Will try with lorem text. 
How to get lorem text: 

Successes:
add lorem text
Add search icon
Add link to lorem source 

Failures: 
float search icon
float image in page content section
change font size of footnote

Didn't get to
increase height of navbar
make bar touch top left and right
