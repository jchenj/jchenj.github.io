	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>I'm Julianna & this is my blog of notes to self, documenting
        selected 'aha moments' from my adventures in software development.</p>

    <p>My largest project so far is <a
            href="https://github.com/jchenj/ezpass">ezpass</a>, a command
        line password manager tool written in Python. Given my longtime
        fascination with databases, I'm also pretty excited about <a
            href="https://github.com/jchenj/standing-db">standing-db</a> a
        database of standing desk locations built using SqlAlchemy and
        sqlite.
      </p>

    <p>For my next project, I'm planning to draw on my experience
        managing an academic leadership development program to create a MongoDB
        database modeling the program's data, including learner & facilitator
        participants, logistical information, session materials, and
        evaluation results.
