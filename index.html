	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>I'm Julianna. This blog contains some notes from my adventures in software development, and documents some of the 'aha moments' I have along the way. As of May 2020, I'm working mostly on task automation, data analysis and web development in Python. You can reach me at <i>c-dot-julianna@gmail.com</i>.</p>
